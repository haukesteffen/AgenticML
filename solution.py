"""
AgenticML solution module.

This file is what you edit for base-model experiments. The harness in ``harness/``
runs cross-validation over the dataset and calls ``fit_predict`` once per fold,
passing only the training and validation slices of that fold. You never see
the other folds, the test set, or the CV indices themselves.

Contract
--------
Define exactly two things at module scope:

  HYPOTHESIS : str
      A one-line plain string literal describing what this attempt tries.
      Used as the git commit message and MLflow tag. Must be a literal — it
      is read via ast.parse without executing the module.

  fit_predict(X_train, y_train, X_val) -> np.ndarray
      Train your model on (X_train, y_train) and return predictions on X_val.

Inputs
------
  X_train : pandas.DataFrame  — training fold features (id column already dropped)
  y_train : numpy.ndarray     — training fold targets (integer-encoded for
                                 classification via pd.factorize, float for regression)
  X_val   : pandas.DataFrame  — validation fold features (id column already dropped)

Return shape
------------
  2D array of shape (len(X_val), n_classes),
  per-class probabilities with columns in
  ascending class-index order (matching pd.factorize
  with sort=True)

Rules
-----
- Do not import or call mlflow — the harness owns logging.
- Do not touch anything under ``harness/``, ``data/``, ``.env``, or ``config.yaml``.
- Do not read test data — you only have what arrives via function arguments.
- Feature engineering must be done inside ``fit_predict`` so it runs on the
  training fold only (no cross-fold leakage).
- HYPOTHESIS must be a plain string literal at module scope.
- Change exactly one axis per attempt: feature engineering, preprocessing,
  hyperparameters, or ensembling. HYPOTHESIS must be a single clause naming
  that one axis. Bundling changes hides which one moved the score and kills
  the next iteration's ability to ablate or revert. This rule is strict.
